Example Code - Donovan Rogall


In this folder you will find a taste of the kinds of code I have worked with.

Not all of the code is completely my original creation, but I have had my hands deep into everything you'll find, maintaining and modifying all of it at one time or another.

This is a good sample of both what I can do and what I can handle taking on as my own.
